## What is Moonbase?

Moonbase is a server plugin for **Jellyfin and Emby** that gives every Moonfin client its shared backbone. It syncs your settings across devices, hosts the Moonfin web app right on your server, adds extra rating sources, connects your library to Seerr, and gives admins server-wide defaults and tools.

> **Recommended:** if you use any Moonfin client, install Moonbase on your server for the best experience.

This repo ships two plugins from one place: a Jellyfin plugin under `Jellyfin/` and an Emby plugin under `Emby/`.

## Installation

Moonbase needs **Jellyfin 10.10 or newer** or **Emby 4.8 or newer**. The wiki's [Installation](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/wiki/Installation) page has the steps plus updating and uninstalling.

### Jellyfin

The plugin repository is the recommended route, because it updates through the catalog like any other plugin:

1. Open the Jellyfin Dashboard, then go to Administration > Plugins > Repositories.
2. Add a repository:
   - **Name:** `Moonbase`
   - **URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/refs/heads/master/manifest.json`
3. Go to Catalog, find **Moonbase**, and install it.
4. Restart Jellyfin.

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced:</b> manual install</summary>

1. Download the latest `Moonfin.Server-x.x.x.x.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/releases)
2. Extract it into your Jellyfin plugins folder:
   | Platform | Path |
   |----------|------|
   | Linux | `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/Moonfin/` |
   | Docker | `/config/plugins/Moonfin/` |
   | Windows | `%ProgramData%\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\Moonfin\` |
3. Restart Jellyfin


</details>

### Emby

The Emby plugin is a drop-in zip, not a catalog plugin:

1. Download the latest `Moonfin.Emby-x.x.x.x.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/releases).
2. Extract its contents (`Emby.Plugins.Moonfin.dll`, `SharpCompress.dll`, and the `web` folder) into your Emby plugins folder:
   | Platform | Path |
   |----------|------|
   | Linux | `/var/lib/emby/plugins/` |
   | Docker | `/config/plugins/` |
   | Windows | `%AppData%\Emby-Server\programdata\plugins\` |
3. Restart Emby.

## Opening the Moonfin Web App

Moonbase serves the Moonfin web app on your own server, so you can open and bookmark it directly:

`https://your-server-host/Moonfin/Web/`

> **Not loading after a fresh install?** Run the **Moonfin Startup** task once (Dashboard > Scheduled Tasks), then refresh your browser.

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced:</b> a Moonfin button in the stock Jellyfin web header</summary>

On Jellyfin, you can add a one-click Moonfin button to the stock web header (next to your user icon) by installing the [File Transformation](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) plugin:

1. Add its plugin repository: `https://www.iamparadox.dev/jellyfin/plugins/manifest.json`
2. Install **File Transformation** from the catalog and restart Jellyfin.
3. Force refresh your browser.

To hide the button while keeping the plugin, add this to Branding > Custom CSS:

```css
.headerMoonfinButton { display: none !important; }
```

On Emby, the web app is served the same way at `/Moonfin/Web/`, but there's no header button because Emby has no equivalent injection path.

## Features

- **Cross-device settings sync**, so your preferences follow you between web, TV, mobile, and desktop, with an optional per-device profile for desktop, mobile, and TV.
- **The Moonfin web app** hosted at `/Moonfin/Web/`, running side by side with the stock web interface.
- **Media bar and home screen data** resolved on the server and shared across clients.
- **Recommendations scored on the server** (Jellyfin), matching similar titles on genres, tags, people, studios, franchise, release year and rating, and only showing what each user is allowed to see. On Jellyfin 12 the same scoring reaches every client, including the stock web interface.
- **Extra rating sources** through MDBList and TMDB, with the API keys kept on the server.
- **Next air dates** for series, taken from the Sonarr your Seerr is connected to, or from TMDB through the server when there's no Sonarr.
- **Anime filler and recap markers** (Jellyfin) that badge episodes as Filler, Mixed, Recap or canon using AnimeFillerList and MyAnimeList, plus Subbed and Dubbed pills read from the audio tracks in your own files. No account or API key needed.
- **Seerr integration** with a built-in proxy, single sign-on, and optional request and issue notifications. The step-by-step guide is [Seerr Setup](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/wiki/Seerr-Setup).
- **Push notifications** that reach Moonfin apps even when they are closed, covering Seerr activity, new media added to your library, and admin broadcasts. See [Seerr Notifications](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/wiki/Seerr-Notifications).
- **Admin tools** for setting server-wide defaults across every client setting, pushing them to existing users, and broadcasting a message to everyone at once.
- **Settings backup and restore** (Jellyfin): Moonbase keeps a spare copy of your server-wide settings and offers to put it back if they ever come back reset.
- **App reports on Emby**, so the apps' Send report to server button works there too. Jellyfin has this built in.
- **Server messages**: an admin can write a note (title, Markdown body, color, audience, start and end dates, an optional link button) that shows up in people's apps, even if they were offline when it was sent.
- **Custom themes** with a built-in editor, plus server-side upload and validation.
- **Retro games** support for browsing and playing game libraries, with saves synced per user. On Jellyfin, an optional switch lets PSP games start in the web app. See [Retro Games](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/wiki/Retro-Games).
- **Custom rows** built from Letterboxd, TMDB, MDBList and IMDb lists, cached on the server.
- **An active downloads dashboard** with live transcode metrics in the admin panel, plus a per-client view so a transcoded download can show its own progress and ETA.
- **Personal ratings served back to clients**, so a library can be sorted by your own rating and filtered by liked or disliked, which neither server can do on its own.
- **Audiobook bookmarks and notes** stored on the server and synced between clients.

## Configuration

Open your server dashboard, go to Plugins, and select **Moonbase**. The [Admin Guide](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin/wiki/Admin-Guide) walks through every tab. The main things to set up:

- Your Seerr URL and whether Seerr is enabled
- Shared MDBList and TMDB API keys, so individual users don't need their own
- Whether Moonbase Sync is on (required for the Seerr and ratings integrations)
- On Jellyfin, anime markers and whether Moonfin Recommends handles similar items
- Default user settings that new users inherit, with a button to push them to existing users
- Server messages and the quick broadcast
- Web startup options and custom theme uploads

Users change their own preferences from the in-app settings page in any Moonfin client. Settings are stored per user and shared across clients, with an optional per-device override for desktop, mobile, and TV.

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced:</b> the Defaults tab</summary>

The Defaults tab covers every client setting in its own subtab, from General Style and Details Screen through Playback and Integrations. Each control mirrors what the clients actually offer, so a default set here is one a client can honor. A setting left on Not set (user decides) passes the user's own choice through.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Check the existing issues first, open an issue before starting a large change, match the existing code style, and test your changes on desktop and mobile. Features that would help all Jellyfin or Emby users are worth proposing upstream first.
